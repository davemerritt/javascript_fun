// EXERCISE: The Fortune Teller

// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

var kids = " 0 ";
var partner = " a full grown bear ";

alert( "You will be" + title + "on" + locale + "and probably not married to" + partner + "so you'll have" + kids + "kids.");
// EXERCISE: The Age Calculator

// Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!

// Store the current year in a variable.
// Store their birth year in a variable.
// Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
// Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.

var currentYear = 2013; 
var birthYear = 1983;
var age1 = currentYear - birthYear;
var age2 = age1 - 1;
alert("My brother is either " + age2 + " or " + age1 +".")
// EXERCISE: The Lifetime Supply Calculator

// Store your current age into a variable.
// Store a maximum age into a variable.

// EXERCISE: The Geometrizer

// Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

// Store a radius into a variable.
// Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
// Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

// EXERCISE: The Temperature Converter

// It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

// Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
// Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
